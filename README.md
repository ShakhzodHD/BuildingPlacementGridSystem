### 🎮 Features  
1. **Building Placement Mechanics**:
   - Select a building type from the interface.
   - Move the building along the grid with fixed step snapping.
   - Confirm placement with a click.

2. **Building Deletion**:
   - Activate deletion mode via the interface.
   - Remove buildings with a single click, freeing grid cells.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Interactive panel with buttons for building selection, placement, and deletion.
   - Minimalistic and responsive design.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Saves the state of placed buildings between sessions using file-based storage.

5. **Clean and Modular Architecture**:
   - Code organized using **Assembly Definition** files for modularity.
   - Input handling implemented with Unity’s **New Input System**.
   - Bootstrap entry point ensures scalable architecture.

6. **Configuration Management**:
   - Easily editable static (configuration) data.
